# Q25.interface is nil

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type People interface {
	Show()
}
type Student struct{}

func (stu *Student) Show() {
}
func main() {
	var s *Student
	if s == nil {
		fmt.Println("s is nil")
	} else {
		fmt.Println("s is not nil")
	}
	var p People = s
	if p == nil {
		fmt.Println("p is nil")
	} else {
		fmt.Println("p is not nil")

**Variable s**:

- `s` is a pointer to a `Student` and it is initialized to `nil`.
- When you check `if s == nil`, it evaluates to `true` because `s` is indeed `nil`. Hence, `"s is nil"` is printed.

**Variable p**:

- `p` is a variable of type `People`, which is an interface. When you assign `s` (which is `nil`) to `p`, something interesting happens.
- Even though `s` is `nil`, when you assign it to the interface `p`, the interface `p` now holds a type (`*Student`) and a value (`nil`).
- In Go, an interface is `nil` only if both its **type** and **value** are `nil`. In this case, the type is `*Student`, and the value is `nil`, so the interface `p` itself is **not** `nil`.
- Hence, when you check `if p == nil`, it evaluates to `false`, and `"p is not nil"` is printed.
